This program package is provided for non-profitable use only. If
you use this package, please send a note so that I can keep track 
of who is using it. To give maximum flexibility, the program package 
is made available in three stand-alone modules: SE, Keypoints, and 
Edgethresh. 

The program SE was initially developped by Friedrich Heitger, however, 
some important improvements have been made by myself. The SE program 
realizes the Suppression and Enhancement (S&E) operator, which is
thoroughly described in [1]. The S&E operator is build upon energy filters
described in [2,3]. An additional paper explaining the key-point scheme 
can be found in [4]. The SE program (optionally) also computes the 
keypoint map as described in [2,3]. Given the keypoint map, key-points 
are extracted with the program Keypoints. This program essentially makes 
local maxima and thresholding operations. If you want more information 
about the energy filters, SE operator, and the key-point sheme (including
parameters) send an e-mail to friedrich.heitger@csemne.ch.

The (edge/line) filter output of the SE program is unthresholded. To 
perform thresholding run the program Edgethresh. The program primarily
makes an automatic thresholding according to the estimated image noise
as is proposed in [5]. A second option with fixed relative threshold also 
exists. 

A summary of the use of the filters, key-points and noise estimation 
(and more) can be found in [6].

INSTRUCTIONS:

First you have to make the libraries (liblowlevel.a and libtools.a).

> cd liblowlevel
> make G=-xO4
> cd ../libtools
> make G=-xO4
> ..

To compile the stand-alone programs write:

> make G=-xO4

To see what options are available type:

> SE
> Keypoints
> Edgethresh

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: 

The transfer of FLOAT data between the different programs 
is done with a simple file format, which gets the extension .dat

The first line contains the word BINARY
The second line contains the image dimensions (int) NX NY
The rest is a binary dump of the data with the size NX*NY*sizeof(float)

The data which is NOT float but UNSIGNED CHAR is transferred between 
the programs as standard SUN rasterfiles. Whenever the program or an 
option needs a 'filename' it implicitly means a filename for a SUN 
rasterfile. The SUN raster-file may be 8 bit with or without colormap 
or a 24 bit sun rasterfile.

In all programs, there exist options to produce other output that 
can be more conveniently viewed or read. 
----------------------------------------------------------------

An example with the SUN raster file hochhaus.ras

> SE -i house.ras -o test -keypoints -quality -sigma 2.25 -raster

will produce the following output

test-nms.ras          (the edge/line pixels encoded with magnitude)
test-maxmap.ras       (magnitude for all pixels)
test-mod_maxmap.ras   (energy of gabor filters)
test-locori.ras       (local orientation [0-180])
test-kptmap.ras       (2-D local energy, i.e. the keypoint map)
test-quality.ras      (general edge quality)
test-type.ras         (edge or line label for each pixel)
test-nms.dat      
test-maxmap.dat
test-mod_maxmap.dat
test-locori.dat
test-kptmap.dat
test-quality.dat

After SE filtering you can extract key-points by writing 

> Keypoints -i test -overlay circle -back house.ras -thresh 30

will produce the following output:

test-kptmap-kpts.ras
test-kptmap-kpts-ovl.ras

The output of the SE program is unthresholded. To produce 
a thresholded version run the program Edgethresh. You can either 
make a fixed or automatic thresholding. 

automatic:

> Edgethresh -i test -sign 99.9 -overlay house.ras

will produce the following output:

test-nms-edgemap.ras
test-nms-edgemap-ovl.ras

the same with a fixed threshold (15%):

> Edgethresh -i test -overlay house.ras -fixed 15

will produce an edgemap with 15% relative threshold.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I know there are many options and possibilities for this kind 
of programs. If you don't understand what is one or what can be
done please write me an email:  ohenri@geod.ethz.ch

Also write me if something doesn't work. I would be offended 
if something doesn't work and you don't tell me about it ...
