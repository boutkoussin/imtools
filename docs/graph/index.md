### `graph` - Graph and network analysis and representation
 
* [bfs_base](bfs_base.html)        - Compute breadth first search distances, times, and tree of a graph and extracts valid paths.
* [dfs_base](dfs_base.html)        - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) of a graph.
* [scomponents_base](scomponents_base.html)  - Compute the strongly connected components of a graph and extracts valid paths.
